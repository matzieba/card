            <p>I have always enjoy figuring out how does something work. If something is broken
            and I get to repair it, it is even better. That is one of the reasons why I decided to focus
                on the back-end development. Learning nuances of my first scripting language; Python bring me super lot
                of fun and satisfaction. I have gut foundations of <span>Flask</span> and I started to learn
                <span>Django.</span></p>
